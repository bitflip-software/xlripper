// if we take the rightmost cell, this tells us how many columns we need. If we take the bottom-
// most cell, this tells us how many rows we need. The data is structured in columnar fasion. That
// is, we present a slice of 'columns', each of which contains a slice of strings representing the
// values in that column.
